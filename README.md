# Budgeting-Program

## Typical Use-Case
As a member at multiple banks, I want to be able to have all of my different accounts in one convenient application. 

### That's where this application comes in
After creating an account, I am able to log in and enter my information for all of my different accounts, including what bank each acount belongs to. 
This information is stored securely online, and keeps track of things such as account deposits and withdrawals, current balance, and monthly expenditure reports.
I am also able to store information like monthly bills/upcoming expenses and budgeting goals in a document that can be accessed and edited at any time.

## Additional Use-Case
As a small bank owner, I don't have my own personalized banking application, and I don't want to outsource a development team to create one for me. Many members complain 
that it is difficult to keep track of their acccount information, and do not want to have to open a browser and log into our website every time they would like to check 
their balance. 

### Again, this is where this application comes in
As a Bank owner, I can log in to my administrator account, and create a Bank object that contains information about my bank's name, location, and the types of accounts 
that we offer. As an admin, I am able to add new admins for my bank, create new types of accounts (Ex. Checking, Savings, etc.), edit the attributes for each account type 
(specific to my bank), view all the users belonging to my bank, and edit my bank information.
